WEBVTT

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.680
OK hello everyone good morning good afternoon and good evening wherever you

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.800
are thank you so much for joining us today in this session

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.850
on introduction to mantra autopilot now we do

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.000
have an interesting session lined up for today but before we go ahead and start

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.130
there are a few housekeeping roles that I would want to share with you

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.200
this session is being recorded and during the session

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.770
you are more than welcome to post your questions in the Q&amp;A tab they will

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.080
be taken up either during or towards the end of the session depending on the time

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090
on the time.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.960
And any unanswered questions will be answered offline and made available on

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.560
the SharePoint.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.690
It was the end of the session of course I will share the thread link in the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.920
Q&amp;A window so please do not forget to claim your credits

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.170
for this session the link will be in the feature tab of your Q and

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.770
A panels.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.480
And that's all from my end so with that I

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.520
would like to hand over the session to our presenters

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.880
for today vikas pratap Singh so vikas over to you now

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.480
Thank you, Sakshi and yeah.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.520
Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the session.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.720
Of Nokia mentoray autopilot my name is

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.760
vikas I'm the product manager who is current

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.840
currently working in the manta

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.600
Fine product that is meant that a autopilot.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.460
During this the course of this presentation uh what

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.000
we will do is we will look into the uh the

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.180
details of uh what autopilot is first

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.940
first, we'll look into the background. What?

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.920
What were the reasons behind which drove

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.760
the creation of this product autopilot will then

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.280
look into how it works what value it brings

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.760
brings, and so on.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.760
Then we'll look at some customer use cases.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.950
Umm the results that we have achieved uh from our differe

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.990
different customers uh we'll then move on to a bit of umm

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.150
umm the the vision that we

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.670
have for autopilot and where we want to head

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.960
So this will be the agenda of this discussion.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.790
On the panel I have Mohan with me you know

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.950
Mohan is one of the senior architects and ment

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.190
mentor is on team he

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.550
is one of the key brains behind autopilot

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.670
as a product so yeah

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.190
Mohan will be helping

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.310
me answer a lot of difficult questions that

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.350
may be coming from you and because they are difficult they go to Mohan

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.980
Umm along with Mohan I have raya and Priya also

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.120
in this call with me from the product portfolio management

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.240
team umm I'm sure they don't need any

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.520
interaction umm they will help us out

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.640
Any brand related questions or anything like that?

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.130
OK so before I get into the discussion probably I'll

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.250
switch off the video just to make sure that the

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.280
bandwidth is not hogged by my face

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.690
and we focus mostly on the discussion

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.240
itself on the material that is being shared so

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.290
So that we start that.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.520
OK so.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.330
What is autopilot autop

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.650
autopilot is a cloud native AI driven network

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.960
optimization solution as you know network opt

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.730
optimization is one of the.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.360
Most challenging aspects that our customers face

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.520
and doing it manually is is is

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.000
a daunting task it's not something that is really

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.200
advisable to do so that

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.880
that is where the mentary autopilot comes into picture.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.140
As he said it's a cloud native AI driven network optimization

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.320
solution it leverages both on

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.680
supervised and unsupervised learning to to

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.720
contextualise the whole network and provide very

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.020
very precise optimization.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.760
What it does is it proactively analyses the network

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.280
performance it generates data driven

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.800
recommendations with fine tuned parameters which is very which are

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.880
are very precise in nature.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.760
Uh it assesses the network objectives and then presents

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.560
those insights in a very user friendly uh

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.960
interface and that is what our autopilot

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.200
as a product is in just will

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.280
of course be getting into the details of this product in the

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.230
Now before we go into the details of the

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.270
autopilot let's first understand the background that

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.430
or the underlying reasons which led to this decision

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.510
of creating autopilot as an

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.910
as an individual independent product.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.560
Those who have been working with manta

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.680
rayson would already know that this

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.040
offering was called Cognitive Son earlier.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.840
And there was a conscious decision taken that

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.320
autopilot should be an independent

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.720
product and not just a value pack within

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.080
the.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.080
What were the reasons that drove us to this discussion

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.080
Well.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.960
The first reason is that we wanted to have independent

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.420
contract negotiations uh which are free from any

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.520
baggage of the existing zone contracts that we have had

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.960
and and the nature those contracts have been

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.340
been built upon.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.190
The next very important aspect was

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.230
in general the product revi vital

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.750
vitalization now here is a product and which

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.310
is plantaray autopilot which truly reflect

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.910
reflects our commitment towards bringing a solution

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.000
Into the AI for ran portfolio right

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.840
we want to address that Dom

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.040
domain that is where autopilot comes into picture

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.080
picture.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.830
It brings in a level 4 autonomous

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.630
operations uh into the fold uh which

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.910
we wanted to have demarcated vis

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.190
visibility from the Level 3

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.110
automation that comes from the mantra song that

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.710
is the reason we wanted autopilot to have its own identity

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.870
which clearly defines that OK this is a AI

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:54.550
is a AI driven product.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:55.640
Which brings in.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.440
Another level of automation on top of the

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.480
existing mentary saw.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.760
Also umm as of today

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.840
umm what autopilot is doing is it's

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.760
orchestrating this on modules of course but we

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.920
do not want that to be restrict

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.400
restricted only to this much scope we

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.520
want that scope to enhance we don't want

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.960
that scope to increase and eventually we want autopilot

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.240
to evolve into orchestrating even custom

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.960
objectives and custom modules and custom objectives are customers

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:39.390
Example have uh hundreds of uh

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:42.710
adapted modules of their own we want autopilot to be

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:46.190
able to orchestrate those modules as well not

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.910
just the standard song modules and

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.950
in future when we get into the smo business

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:56.070
we want this autopilot

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:59.870
to be able to orchestrate our apps custom our apps and 3rd

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:00.630
and 3rd party our apps as well.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.640
So these were the reasons.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:04.960
Behind.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.640
The decision of announcing autopilot as an individ

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.680
individual independent product.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.820
During this course of presentation we'll talk about level

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.920
4 automation quite often so here I just want to

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.960
explain what are different levels what

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.200
is this level 4 so we have this forum

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.400
called Tele management forum as you would already know which defines various

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.380
various levels of autonomous operations.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.440
Now to be at level 4.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.240
The solution or the the product needs to be able to

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.640
make intent based.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.560
Decisions autonomously Nokia

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.840
already has that offering which is autopilot

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.560
and it caters to uh umm various

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.680
used cases key used cases uh

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.960
with level 4 autonomous operation right and

00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.420
right? And that is why.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.960
It's important that we segregate it from the typical

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.640
automated solution that we have had so far.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:16.510
So let's look at the evolution journey of autopilot

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:21.560
And it starts with the need to autom

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.760
automate the whole network optimization itself if

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.880
we we do not have any kind of automation and the operator

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.200
operator has to handle it manually.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.240
It's a daunting task you have to manually monitor the

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.480
KPIs you have to do analysis identify where

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:41.280
the network performance degradations are happening then

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.840
you have to manually map the solutions using some scripts or

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.000
you have to create the correction forms manual plans

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.800
manually to fix the problem and once those solutions

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:52.520
solutions are applied.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.320
Then verify the results manually and if the need be rolled it back

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.640
and this may take weeks, maybe months.

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:04.590
Then came uh our classic song

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:08.030
the Mandarin song which provides a human

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.790
human led automated solution.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.320
It comes with automated report generation for any

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.400
kind of problem analysis.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.400
Umm the solution mapping uh it comes in the

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.280
form of various on used cases on modules uh but

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.400
then which some module has to be applied where that is

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.680
that is decided by the operator manually

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.880
basically it's a experience based Sol

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.880
And once the solution has been deployed we talk about that that that

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.120
is when the verification the rollback part comes into picture where

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.560
manually one has to verify the outcome and

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.800
if there is a need trigger the

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.360
automated rollback but at least trigger it initiate it

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.600
Manually after the analysis of.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.880
The results of our solution orchestration.

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:05.040
Autopilot brings in the next level of automation

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:05.050


00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:08.790
The entire analysis of the network.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.440
The the objectives of the network and the

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:18.200
thresholds the performance KPIs everything is auton

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.360
autonomously analysed by the autopilot without

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.120
without any manual intervention.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:27.000
The solutions are pre mapped as of now so you have

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.120
these on modules which are mapped

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.360
to the objectives that we have and what those objectives

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.600
objectives are. We'll look into them in the coming slides.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.400
They are already mapped and they are deployed only on the

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.600
problematic cells not in the entire network only on the

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.720
problematic sense with precise

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.200
precise calibration.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.640
Even the verification of the result

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.960
is autonomous where it can be auto verified and

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.520
and needed adjustments can be done automatically.

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:02.610
So this is the evolution journey of autopilot.

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:08.230
And with that you see the human intervention has reduced now

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:11.550
how exactly it works uh we will look into this

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:16.110
and this particular slide now if

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:19.190
you look at any network optim

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:21.190
optimization operation, these are various phases.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:26.200
First one is you have

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:30.280
to identify what is the object objective towards which we are

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.480
running any network optimization operation or

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:33.880
project.

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:38.610
Understand the current state understand what

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:41.880
solution needs to be deployed and then analyse whether the

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:48.660
At the top we'll see how it is managed

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.960
in using the classic song so when

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:56.000
we are talking about classic song we do not have a

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.240
very well defined or rather these

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.440
objectives are not defined in a very

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.960
crisp boundaries they are very fluidic in nature they are

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:09.240
driven by various KPIs they are handled

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:09.580
handled by.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:14.000
They're driven by the problem statements and trigger points that

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.080
may arise from the various user

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:20.960
interfaces that the operator has

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:21.480
access to.

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.920
Now to understand that the operator

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:29.400
has to go through numerous data sets they have

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:33.060
the operate the network engineers working towards the

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.180
the overall network optimization.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:40.280
They have to be an expert in ram they

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.760
have this is entirely experience driven operation and

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.960
now after analysing these numerous data set

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.520
sets the trigger points that is when the operator

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:54.040
or the network engineer decides OK now

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:57.240
we have to bring in these

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:00.440
on used cases into picture the son use cases the son

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:05.000
Will run in closed loop they will they

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.720
They will automate the whole operation.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:12.240
The optimization operation itself but which module

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.400
to use and with what parameters

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.920
what settings is something that is handled by the network engine

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.840
engineer. So not only does the network engineer need to be.

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:26.600
An expert in the ran they have to be

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.660
an expert in so on also they have to have a very

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:33.480
good understanding on how sewn works once

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.780
the solution is deployed then the outcome

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:38.140
outcome is analysed.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.080
And and if it is fine good enough if not

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.200
not then.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.600
Rollback operations need to be performed.

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:54.410
Now any song customer that we have.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:59.640
Will find if at all there are challenges found

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:03.640
they will find challenges in these two phases analy

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:07.080
analysing the overall network data coming

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:10.280
up with the problem statement and then triggering the

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.280
the right sound solutions.

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:16.870
This is where autopilot comes into picture now

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:20.270
in case of auto autopilot first of all the

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:23.670
objectives are clearly have clearly defined boundaries we have these

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:26.750
three shipped objectives retainability

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:30.070
mobility accessibility availability and throughput

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:33.150
now these are the objectives that the oper

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:36.390
operator will work for and this is the input from the operator for example the

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:38.670
example, the operator can say I want to improve my mobility.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.560
The moment your network is integrated into autopil

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:46.800
autopilot the first thing that it does is it understands the layout of

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.840
the land it understands the whole network and

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.440
and creates a context.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.840
On top of which it will build its solution.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.360
Once that context is created then

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.570
it labels the the

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:06.250
all the all the cells on various charac

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:06.730
characteristics.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.960
Based on this labelling then it'll decide

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:18.280
which ones are the cells which are

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:21.760
positing which are which are contributing positively to

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:24.960
any of these objectives and which are contributing

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:31.280
And with that it will identify the problem

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:38.160
And then comes the solution so problem and

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:42.280
as as you can see the whole analysis is autonomous problem

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:46.080
identification is autonomous and now comes the solution

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.400
orchestration that itself is autonomous so

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.920
we have free ship modules which are already

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.880
already mapped to these objectives.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.760
The autopilot will calibrate the right settings for those objectives and

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:03.200
then deploy those objectives based on the context

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.320
that it has created in the previous steps once

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:09.080
Once deployed, the whole result is auto verified.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.680
And then if there is a need

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.940
of course, needed rollbacks are found.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.440
So this is how autopilot brings value

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:28.860
How does it do that architecturally what does it look like uh

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:32.280
here I'm trying to explain to you uh in two different sections

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:35.400
on the left hand side you see uh augmented is on

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:39.520
solution itself which brings in the Level 3 automation and the

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:42.740
network optimization but here there are a lot

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:45.960
of inputs needed from the user the topology capacity

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:49.100
coverage frequency and so on with all these

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.160
inputs fed into the mentor S on mentor S on then

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:52.180
mentor S on then.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:56.360
Performs optimization and planning of the network and

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.080
it may takes hours or days also.

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:05.790
Now on top of that what we have done is we have

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:06.510
have brought in.

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:12.080
This AI enabled product called autopilot in terms

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.200
of input it does not need much from the user just the

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.520
objectives that the user aims to improve which

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.920
can be throughput availability through mobility

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.600
mobility, accessibility and returnability.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.680
Once that is fed OK which objective does

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:32.200
autopilot need to focus on which all object

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.240
objective does it need to focus on?

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.760
It uses the.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.760
Very badly tested mentally is on mod

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.800
modules uh through the NBA

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.880
that it provides uh it uses those mod

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.200
modules to then deploy a solution in a very pre

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.400
precise format so here it leverages on

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.920
this battle tested platform but

00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:00.080
the whole analysis is handled auton

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:03.440
autonomously by the autopilot and that is where it brings in

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.240
in a level 4 automation.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:06.920
Or autonomous execution.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:13.320
Obviously it is much faster umm uh as

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.920
compared to where it may take days in case

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.240
case of autopilot, it may take minutes.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.440
On the coming slides I will talk about

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:28.040
The.

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:35.920
The intrinsic algorithm that that autopil

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:36.560
Autopilot uses, the.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.960
The fundamental framework that it acts upon in order to achieve

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:42.480
its objective.

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:48.000
The first thing that we need to understand is the foundation

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.890
on which this entire algorithm is built.

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:56.240
If you take any aiml solution any

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.010
any AI product.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:01.840
The most fundamental aspect of it

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.520
Fundamental thing that it needs to achieve is

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:13.240
To understand the layout of the land that it has to act upon take

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:16.560
for example the automated cars if you if

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:20.440
a level of adas or automation it

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:23.640
needs to achieve on the road it has to understand exactly

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.520
exactly where it is, what kind of traffic.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:33.040
What kind of speed zone it is in what is its geograph

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:33.480
geographical location?

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:37.160
What kind of neighbourhood it is in and so on so forth

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.280
right that is exactly what aut

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.400
autopilot also does the moment you integrate your network

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.640
to autopilot it understands the layout of the

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:49.860
land it understands the context it creates a context of

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:52.580
context of the whole network, and how does it do so?

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:57.520
It uses both static and dynamic

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.720
characteristics of all the cells in that

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:04.440
network in terms of static labelling we take

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:07.800
into account 23 labels which can be location based

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:07.880
based.

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:12.450
Uh DN server type uh various ident

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:18.840
Then we have dynamic characteristics such as location deploy

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:22.120
deployment and what kind of deployment area it is it is an urban location

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.740
location, it is a suburban location or a rural area.

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.440
What kind of density is it in is it

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.960
in an ultra dense location such

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:36.160
as maybe central business district of Bangalore

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:42.110
Or in a relatively less dense location or

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:44.070
or some sparse location.

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:50.060
And then we have a lot of kpi based or SLI based

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:53.280
labels such as what kind of mobility we have for the

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:56.520
cell which again dynamic in nature the kind of traffic volume

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.580
what kind of coverage we have whether the uplink and DL traffic is

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:02.600
good or bad the load share the wise

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:03.380
the wise share and so on and so forth.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.320
Using all of this information it creates

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.600
a context it performs uh contextualization

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:15.120
and creates network segments what

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.360
are these segments now segmentation of

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:21.640
the network is done based on these characteristics

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.920
and some subclusters are created based on the common

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:28.120
characteristics so for example it'll have a bunch of cells which

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.320
which are urban ultra dense.

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:33.320
It'll have a bunch of cells which are rude and sparse so

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:36.400
on so forth and this is just one example that I

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.440
m thinking but as I said that we apply

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.720
apply machine learning capabilities.

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:45.610
Uh to understand and uh analyse

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:48.720
the static and dynamic characteristics and create these segments

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:54.220
And what it does is that it provides a very

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:57.520
good a tremendous context using which the

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.780
autopilot understands the the the the

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:03.900
problems of the cell and then goes

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:07.120
on to tailor a solution for

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:10.640
those problematic cells and not the entire network

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:17.230
OK let me have a sip of water because apparently

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:21.630
there's too much information coming out of my mouth so

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:22.390
So give me a second please.

00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:28.310
Yeah.

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.920
So now that we have created the context let's look at

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:37.440
the entire workflow which the autopilot uses in order

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.680
to deploy a solution so the first step

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:44.440
we have already discussed a context is created the

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:48.600
entire network can be contextualised within minutes not

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:51.880
this but just minutes one used case that

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:55.280
we saw was almost 186 cases were

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:55.400
cases were context sliced.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:56.960
Within.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:23:59.960
Within 30 minutes.

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:01.390
Right.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:06.440
Once this labelling is done static and

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.920
dynamic both in nature then context

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:13.120
groupings are created subclusters are created

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:19.480
Identify precise problems and

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:20.840
deploy precise solutions.

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:24.850
Once these sub clusters are created.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.440
Now let's take an example of one particular objective let's say

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:32.520
mobility now operator wants OK my mobility I

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:36.560
have to ensure that I have high mobility in all these CL

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:36.880
these clusters.

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:41.680
Now the parameters defining

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:47.180
A high performing cell may differ from

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:50.300
an urban ultra dense location from a

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:54.240
rural ultra rural sparse location so

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.380
even the thresholds that define whether a cell

00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:00.560
is contributing positively to this objective or neg

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:04.040
negatively to this objective is depending

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.020
depending dependent on the context.

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:11.000
Let's say for an urban ultra dense location we have

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:11.640
the subcluster.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:16.480
What we do is we identify what are my top 95th

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:17.320
percentile cells.

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:22.450
And what are the parameters how how they're behaving uh

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:25.520
we identify that what is the kpi

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.760
of those cells and that becomes my benchmark that defines

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:29.450
defines the threshold.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.600
Above that threshold the cells are positive are

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:38.480
contributing positively to this particular objective and

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.520
and below that they are not.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.280
Contributing positively rather contributing negatively to the object

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:45.600
objective.

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:50.600
Now once these threshold are defined again

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:53.040
again, this is very dynamic in nature.

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:57.520
These thresholds can change

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:00.580
on a very regular basis we can perform this

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:03.940
threshold computation on a daily basis and

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:07.040
it can happen in minutes so we

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:10.480
do not have a standard solution for weeks and months

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:13.940
rather it is very real time it is

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:14.540
It is very.

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:16.560
What do you say?

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:22.930
Uh uh you know uh take into account the latest

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:23.890
latest happenings in the network.

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:27.740
So now threshold computation is done.

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.480
Uh and umm after the threshold computation

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:36.240
is completed uh comes the problem ident

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.480
identification or problem detection as I said you ident

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:42.720
identify the top it's 95 percentile cells and

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:46.240
then identify the cells which are not contributing or not match

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:52.520
Then once you have identified these cells

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:55.560
you know that these are problematic cells and you can

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:59.120
only focus on those cells you can you can provide

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:02.130
the net the solution to

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:03.330
to those cells.

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:09.190
Right umm as opposed to uh any other Sol

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:12.550
solution where you have to deploy we we generally go with the

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:15.750
uh orchestration of the entire network or we

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:18.350
we go with a solution deployment on the entire network.

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:23.460
Here we are targeting only the problematic sense now

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:26.520
not only do we have very tailored

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:30.240
precise threshold definition we also have tailored

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.300
tailored solution orchestration.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:37.800
The for to achieve the mobility object

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:41.040
objective the modules on modules that come into use are

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:41.920
are an R.

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:48.160
PCI and prach now for an urban sparse location

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:51.840
the parameters or the settings needed for those partic

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:52.440
particular sound modules.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.800
Would be may be different from the ones in urban

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.720
uh, in rural or sparse uh area, right?

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.600
So even solution orchestration part the Sol

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.640
module that we deploy have very precise setting

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:10.800
settings which are tailored as per that context

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:15.630
And all of it is done autonomously so here you can

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:18.870
see without manual intervention we have identified the

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:22.510
problem we have and

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:26.110
and in a very precise manner only the problematic sense and

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:29.310
we have found the solution in a very orgas

00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:32.470
very precise manner for those problem

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:33.190
problematic cells.

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:37.670
And they're tailored to the needs as per the context

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:39.070
of that particular set.

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:45.500
So this was the entire workflow

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:47.980
of the execution.

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:50.120
Of an autopilot.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:55.000
Of the autopilot in order to achieve any of these objectives.

00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:00.280
We will move on to see how what objectives

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:03.760
could we currently have this is the current view

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:06.960
of currently available objectives and mod

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:10.920
modules obviously it is subject

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:14.160
to change a lot of places where the pilot is

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:14.320
is ongoing.

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:18.240
Upon completion the status will change but as of today

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:21.440
these are uh different objectives and modules that we

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.480
have to offer in case of 4G we have return

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:27.730
returnability throughput availability accessibility and mobility

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:28.250
mobility objectives.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:33.200
And in case of 5G we have throughput accessibility and mobility

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.280
now in order to achieve these object and these are categories

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:39.400
of the objectives each of these objective categ

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:43.040
category will have the corresponding different well defin

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:46.280
defined object is what will be a part of this category

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:49.560
for example mobility will have these

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:53.080
different objectives cells that are

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:53.160
are.

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:57.980
That have good intra Lt mobility good W

00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:01.480
WCBMPSHO base mobility irad based

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:04.760
mobility and so on so forth now to achieve these

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:05.500
these objectives.

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:09.900
Uh what are the solutions that will be deployed in order to

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:12.940
fix the problematic cells or uh

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:16.020
improve the performance in the problematic cells those are the

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:19.180
son modules that will be invoked from

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:23.180
from the autopilot. If the cell is not.

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:28.140
Is not performing to the as per the

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:31.500
threshold identified during the course of threshold or if ident

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.900
identification so these are the modules these are

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:38.020
standard modules so whenever autopilot is

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:41.780
executed it needs to be ensured that cor

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:45.340
corresponding son has the licence for these modules it

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:48.460
the underlying son should have these modules if these modules

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:49.940
modules are not there then.

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:52.180
For any given objective, let's say.

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:56.130
Uh for uh mobility if uh AN

00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:59.330
ANR is not present on the pcip rach is present then

00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:01.090
then only those modules will be invoked.

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:05.900
Right so here you can see a lot of places pilot

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:09.500
doesn't still needed uh a lot of places pilot is ongo

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:12.580
ongoing and when that pilot is available uh pilot

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:15.740
is successfully completed they'll be declared ga where

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:18.900
wherever you see a release mentioned that is where

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:19.100
where the.

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:23.980
Module has already achieved G or general availability

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:30.550
OK so these were the details of how autop

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:33.580
autopilot works we will quickly

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:36.830
and delve into the results

00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:38.470
results that Autopilot has brought in.

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:43.780
These are the results from the pilot that

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:46.980
we are doing for T-Mobile and obviously by the

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:50.060
way these are customer specific this is this is still under

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:53.220
foaa so it

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:56.260
cannot be shared with other customers this is for Nokia internal

00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:56.620
internal use only.

00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:59.560
This particular slide.

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:02.580
Now in order to.

00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:07.660
Deliberate or in order to identify or rather judge

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:11.060
the performance of autopilot itself these are

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:14.140
the categories under which we have eval

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:17.420
evaluated it for T-Mobile which is automated

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:20.340
automated, operational intelligence, improved precision.

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:25.020
Reduce time for network in suboptimal state and

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:27.580
improved network performance.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:32.800
Automated operational intelligence what it means is

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:36.120
how fast can we uh what kind of autom

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:40.020
automation or autonomous execution can we bring in using

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:43.140
uh autopilot now if the

00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:46.600
autopilot is not used the phase where

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:49.840
we can textilize the whole network would

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:53.180
take weeks now we do not have a formal contextualization phase

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:58.620
I don't think any operator does that but primarily what it means

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:01.900
is the whole data analysis understanding of the network

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:05.100
would still be needed so if you are doing it for the first time

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:05.980
time, it may take.

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:10.780
Days maybe weeks to understand the context of the entire

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:11.140
entire network.

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:16.180
Now in case of autopilot that can be achieved within 30 minutes

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:19.660
so all the labelling static and dynamic is done

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:22.620
done and these contexts are created within 30 minutes.

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:26.180
And within 30 minutes we are able to.

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:31.780
Evaluate the objective also so we can identify which cells are

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:35.260
Are contributing positively.

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:39.290
To the set objectives and which are not

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:42.850
so basically you are able to identify the

00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:45.090
the problematic sense as well within 30 minutes.

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:50.340
Then comes the aspect of improved

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:50.460
precision.

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:55.460
Uh what we want is that we are able to achieve

00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:58.940
the same results as that of song

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:02.740
by targeting minimal number

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:06.940
of cells so that we have more precised solution

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:10.500
of more precise operation

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:13.940
so here in this graph for example it

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:16.260
it's a little small. I'm sorry for that, but I'll try to explain.

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:19.540
The first bar that you see is the.

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:23.980
Uh subclusters with dynamic threshold so basically

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:27.180
these this these are the subclusters that were target

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:32.100
Right so for example these were the number of subclust

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:36.180
subclusters on which uh the operation ran the 2nd

00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:39.660
second one you see is the number of parameters per

00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:42.680
sub clusters were that were actually changed

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:43.280
changed using the.

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:45.380
Autopilot.

00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:50.860
Product and as you can see it's

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:54.700
very small in number in most of the cases it is not

00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:57.860
going beyond 10 right and we are able

00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:58.860
able to achieve the same.

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:04.180
Level of improvement uh targeting

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:05.510
Targeting minimal number of changes.

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:10.500
And the last bar that you see is focus percent

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:13.860
percentage of problematic cells as I had mentioned

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:16.910
with Sean if you want to for example run

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:20.220
coc on uh entire cluster and find all

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:23.420
the outages you may have to run that solution

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:26.860
on a entire subcluster or entire network

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:30.270
and then identify those outages with

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:33.030
with Autopilot. You can actually target.

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:36.860
A very small percentage of those cells now in this case

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:40.740
for example prach had targeted just below

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:41.300
below 10%.

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:45.770
Almost 9% of the cells uh to uh to bring in

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:48.930
the same amount of improvement uh for the object

00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:52.610
objective that we were uh aiming at and none of these do you see

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:55.810
goes beyond 20% apart from an rvln

00:35:55.810 --> 00:35:59.450
cclv slv but most of the cases what we

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:02.730
see is we are able to achieve the

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:06.410
same amount of network improvement by targeting very

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:07.010
very few cells.

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:11.900
And that is the precise precise nature of our solution deployment I'll

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:15.060
give you an example of coc itself in one used case where

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:15.100
where.

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:19.940
Using mentor is on 5000

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:23.740
cells were identified were analysed

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:25.820
analysed to identify 7 outages.

00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:30.070
Using autopilot the same number of outages or the same out

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:33.500
outages could be identified by analysing just 92 cells

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:36.620
so that is the level of precision we are talking about

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:39.750
and it's not just about targeting

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:42.780
the problematic cells or a fewer number of cells

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:46.270
it's also about defining precise

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:50.100
parameters for those solutions so

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:53.030
So the modules that will be involved will be.

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:57.220
With the tailored settings as per the context of that

00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:00.220
particular set and that is what brings in the high precision.

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:06.210
Reduce time for the network in sub optimization state

00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:09.410
or sub optimal state what it means is that you are

00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:09.930
are able to.

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:16.220
Identify the problems and fix the problems at a much faster

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:19.260
rate if we look at mod

00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:22.420
module execution we were able to

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:25.820
achieve module execution 22 times

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:28.940
faster more for when we had run multiple

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:32.860
modules Mr OC NR and so on so forth almost

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:34.140
almost 22% faster.

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:38.940
87 time percent faster problem detection

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:39.980
and repair.

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:44.460
87% and that is because we are not

00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:44.510


00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:49.340
Deploying these modules on the entire network but we

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:51.660
we are going with a very precise approach.

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:56.420
A very surgical way to approach the problem

00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:02.500
And last but not least improved performance improved

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:05.780
network performance as I said that

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:05.860
that.

00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:11.450
Despite targeting very few cells we are

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:14.490
able to achieve total parity and

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:18.130
in a lot of cases improvement as well over

00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:21.930
and above the optimization that we had achieved

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:25.250
using the son module the classic

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:28.650
method is on itself right in a lot of cases we see a lot of

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:32.090
improvement and at least total parity was there

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:40.700
Then we talked about improved precision solution orchestration

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:40.720


00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:46.210
Umm of course we have talked

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:49.730
about it earlier also umm the the

00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:52.930
solution that we are deploying that itself is very precise

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:53.330
precise in nature.

00:38:56.710 --> 00:39:00.020
So this was for TMO the current side

00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:03.470
talks about uh our results in nea

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:11.700
Used case already which is out which is

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:12.820
out in the public domain.

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:17.980
In case of stc almost a million corrected us

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:19.660
users were there and this.

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:24.740
Trial was done during the Hajj period where the operators are

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:27.820
they freeze their networks they generally do not touch their networ

00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:31.140
networks they don't make any changes in the networks just to make sure

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:35.300
that you know everything goes fine and there are the

00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:39.100
whole event goes uneven the whole Hajj

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:40.700
Hajj period goes on in eventful.

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:45.550
There autopilot was deployed we had almost

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:48.670
a million connected users 20,000 simultaneously

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:49.350
simultaneously connected users.

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:54.060
Who were moving from one place to another, so a few.

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:59.060
Know about haj you know that the pilgrims move

00:39:59.060 --> 00:39:59.700
move from one place to another.

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:02.940
And they keep on moving.

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:09.380
So there is a very high level of mobility what we

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:13.180
were able to achieve was 20% higher

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:17.260
14% more connected users and

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:20.470
10% higher ddl throughput all

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:23.510
this by doing almost 10,000

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:25.310
000 autonomous optimizations.

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:31.020
Per hour in a network where generally no

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:34.540
changes are allowed during the time of Hajj so

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:37.740
that is the level of improvement that

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:47.360
Now here we will look at the various deployment models off

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:50.660
song so autopilot is a soft

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:53.320
software only delivery which can be deployed.

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:54.980
On.

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.040
Just one second please.

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:09.980
Yeah so which can be deployed on the NMCC

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:13.040
NMCCP blueprint solution umm it can be deployed on

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:16.300
top of the umm so the the

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:20.200
blueprint solution from nccp it can be deployed on top of HP

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:23.900
DL360 Gen 11 hardware with

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:24.720
hardware with Electra storage.

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:29.060
From product line, this is the offering that we have.

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:36.460
And then there are various other deployment models where

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:36.660
we.

00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:41.020
Have to bring in the services engagement now from.

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:46.340
The blueprint solution the initial configuration that we started with

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:50.500
was one provisional node 3

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:54.020
computational node and six control nodes that is some around

00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:57.220
10 servers but we were able to optimise it and

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:02.420
What we need is 7 servers one for provision 1

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:05.020
1 computational and one control node.

00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:09.410
We are working on uh reducing it

00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:14.130
further so that uh we are able to achieve umm for

00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:18.370
pocs for example uh we can uh for uh a target

00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:22.530
of 160 K cells uh we can use uh the

00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:26.330
deployment on uh A4 server configuration where

00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:29.490
one for will be for provision node and three for comput

00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:30.250
computational and control.

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:34.940
Then there are various deployment models where serv

00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:37.980
services engagements can be brought into play

00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:43.540
Umm one is the bare metal approach itself which uh where

00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:46.820
the current minimum configuration uh that services team

00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:49.950
has tried upon is for 50 cases can be used for poc

00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:50.350
Pocs and.

00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:56.020
Uh and pilots up and so on where just

00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:59.220
4 servers are needed then we have these other

00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:02.780
deployment models this for bare metal then we have that other deploy

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:05.940
deployment models where even the hardware is provided by the customer

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:10.020
and Nokia provides only the ohc

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:13.340
ohcp ocp and the platform components from

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:14.340
components from NMCCP.

00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:19.570
Umm yet another umm approach is where

00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:22.650
uh the ocp comes from

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:25.730
the customer the hardware and ocp both come from

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:32.380
All these three deployment modules require serv

00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:32.700
services engagement.

00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:40.820
OK.

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:45.860
So this was all about what autopilot is doing as

00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:48.620
of now, what was the deployment model and so on so forth.

00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:55.220
Here in this slide what I talked about is the

00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:57.260
future, the vision that Autopilot has.

00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:02.140
As of now it's what is already available is

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:05.180
network contextualization and algor

00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:05.900
algorithm orchestration.

00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:10.900
The next step would be to bring in custom objectives

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:14.220
and module registration and what does that mean as of now

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:17.380
we have some preshhed objectives

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:20.580
and the son modules which are mapped to these objectives

00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:20.620
objectives.

00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:25.930
Our customers already have hundreds of adapted modules

00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:28.650
of their own that they use to orchestrate their network.

00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:30.660
Now.

00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:36.100
They should be able to define their own objectives and they

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:39.340
should be able to register their own modules to

00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:43.460
these objectives in order to deploy their solution

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:43.500


00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:48.380
That is the next level of flex

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:52.180
flexibility that we want to bring in with autopilot so along with the object

00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:52.860
objectives that we are shipping.

00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:57.360
It is possible to define custom objectives and

00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:00.460
register the custom uh

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:03.700
modules or the adapter modules by the users uh

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:06.840
to these objectives that is the next level that we

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:12.220
Then comes the extreme intent based on what it

00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:15.700
means is as of now we have objective we have int

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:19.260
intents intent based solution but then still

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:20.300
still this rule driven.

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:25.800
With extreme intent based on umm what

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:28.820
we want to achieve is that we

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:32.680
want the customer to only give the intent and

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:35.700
we derive the rule using that intent the autopil

00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:38.280
autopilot drives that rule using that intent.

00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:43.220
And ultimately what we want to achieve

00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:46.500
is predictive problem solving so as of now autopilot is

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:49.660
reactive in nature it acts upon the KP

00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:51.580
KPIs, network performance and so on so forth.

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:56.660
What we want to achieve is that autopilot is able to predict

00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:59.260
the problems and then provide solutions.

00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:02.820
In order to address those problems proactively.

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:07.330
That is the ultimate aim that we have for Autopilot.

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:13.300
So this I come to the end of the presentation for

00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:16.000
more information. We have links here and.

00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:20.980
The list of contacts are also there from portfolio

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:21.300
management.

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:26.420
You can contact toya from product management you can

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:29.820
contact me and for any

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:33.140
architectural topics Mohan can

00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:36.260
be contacted or else for all the topics you

00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:37.300
You can contact me and then I can.

00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:40.180
Direct it towards.

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:45.400
Towards the relevant stakeholders and get your answers.

00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:53.770
Thank you, vikas. Maybe we shall take.

00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:59.180
Some questions that has been coming several quest

00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:00.660
questions related to the.

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:10.780
Day that not only for the 15

00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:14.660
minute intervals but also for

00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:17.740
the trace based data do

00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:25.520
OK, I'm not.

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:30.440
Having access to umm the

00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:33.460
if you can give me just one minute I'll just

00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:34.560
just go on to the.

00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:39.420
The questions.

00:47:44.350 --> 00:47:47.470
The question is many customers have asked

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:49.350
asked real time Autopilot.

00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:54.500
And the one second reaction time instead of 50

00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:56.580
minutes, is there any plans for this?

00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:01.660
OK I think one second as of now no

00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:06.980
What we have so for example sdc itself we

00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:10.300
were able to initially the reaction time

00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:13.500
we were analysing some 8 hours data and

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:13.580
and all that.

00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:17.940
Uh we brought it down to 15 minutes uh as

00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:21.070
of now umm we do not really

00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:25.100
have that plan to reduce it further umm but then

00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:28.260
yes in future probably we'll come down to 5

00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:33.860
But as of now it is there are other activities which are on the cards

00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:33.900
cards.

00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:38.540
OK then the next next next

00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:42.140
question is that is autopilot deploy

00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:42.940
deployed commercially?

00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:46.580
Anywhere globally or is it still

00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:50.100
in trial or proof of concept phase

00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:50.110
phase?

00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:54.660
We do not have a commercial deployment as such, but.

00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:04.340
With TMO we are we have done a

00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:07.860
very extensive pilot and hope

00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:11.380
hopefully by end of 2025 or maybe first

00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:14.580
half of 2026 we should be able to deploy

00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:14.980
it commercially.

00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:19.200
OK. Thank you then.

00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:24.820
Next questions now we are going a bit different area

00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:28.340
the question is many optim

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:31.540
optimization activities gain better results when

00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:34.740
applied to bigger area than just

00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:38.580
the poorly performing sales how

00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:42.020
does outer payler autopilot takes this into

00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:42.300
into account?

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:48.900
Could you repeat that question I'm sorry uh yes yes yes many

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:52.780
optimization activities gain better results

00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:56.100
than applied to bigger area than us

00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:56.120
than us.

00:49:57.660 --> 00:50:00.980
Poorly performing sales how does aut

00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:02.740
Autopilot takes this into account?

00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:05.260
OK so.

00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:07.860
As I said that.

00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:14.140
What we are trying to achieve is more pre

00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:14.820
precision with autopilot.

00:50:17.810 --> 00:50:20.890
If we are analysing these subclusters and

00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:22.090
these subclusters are.

00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:27.020
Created based on the existing characterist

00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:27.580
characteristics of the soils.

00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:33.460
Cells of similar characteristics are grouped together and

00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:37.020
the threshold to identify whether

00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:39.660
a cell is performing poorly or not.

00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:41.300
Is.

00:50:42.930 --> 00:50:46.610
Calculated or computed for that particular subcluster if there are

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:49.770
more number of cells which are problematic then obvious

00:50:49.770 --> 00:50:53.290
obviously the number of cells which are uh which we are

00:50:53.290 --> 00:50:56.530
targeting will be higher and

00:50:56.530 --> 00:50:59.890
of course there are set parameters that

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:03.130
can be defined in order to decide what

00:51:03.130 --> 00:51:06.330
all parameters should be targeted for solution

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:12.380
So that is also something which is a flexibility that is already available

00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:12.460


00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:16.620
Uh maybe umm Mohan can give more

00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:20.150
information on this uh Mohan maybe umm if

00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:21.270
umm, if you can take that question for me.

00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:26.740
Sure because I yeah I am at least I was typing

00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:29.900
this but it's a very very valid question so

00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:33.230
when we have this kind of solution orch

00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:36.390
orchestration it is just not the problem at excel but

00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:39.500
we also want to have additional cells

00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:42.990
which are needed to be orchestrated so that it can

00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:46.390
provide the much more optimal value so that is the reason autop

00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:49.630
autopilot brings in a capability called a supplementary

00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:53.980
So it's just not based on the solution we are orchestrating along

00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:57.380
with the problem at excel it will also try to include the supp

00:51:57.380 --> 00:52:00.860
supplementary cells as well so for in classic

00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:04.100
example it can be the reuse modules so the

00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:06.460
the reuse modules when we are doing this.

00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:11.190
It is just not the problematic self by just changing the

00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:14.310
RSA or apci value for a a supplement

00:52:14.310 --> 00:52:17.580
supplementary cell can also resolve the problem at excel's problem so

00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:20.940
that's the focus area and it can be

00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:24.500
compensate even it can be taken for sell out

00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:27.910
outage compensation so even though you have an outage cell actual

00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:31.220
compensation cell is also needed for it

00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:34.340
to be offloading those traffic as well for the out

00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:34.870
out itself so.

00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:39.100
Autopilot is taking care of these based on the solutions which

00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:39.940
it is orchestrating.

00:52:41.170 --> 00:52:44.490
Yeah and especially for reuse uh modules

00:52:44.490 --> 00:52:45.970
modules that we have such as PC and P.

00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:52.060
It is just not possible to target only the problematic cells if you're

00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:54.620
re changing the swapping the pcis or changing the pcis.

00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:59.460
The conflicts also have to be resolved so all those changes are

00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:00.740
are handled by Autopilot.

00:53:04.350 --> 00:53:07.830
Then I think that this this is our last quest

00:53:07.830 --> 00:53:11.110
question now is the question is

00:53:11.110 --> 00:53:14.180
when AI uses will be

00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:17.190
extended to help our customers to

00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:20.340
identify the optimal parameter setting

00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:21.950
settings at cell level.

00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:26.980
For different run features that goes beyond PCI

00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:30.060
per us and an R

00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:33.740
is there this kind of planning

00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:33.780


00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:35.770
Currently.

00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:38.940
Are we? Is there any plans for that?

00:53:42.370 --> 00:53:43.570
OK so.

00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:48.500
Maybe I need some follow up information on that

00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:51.750
uh front what do we mean by that umm

00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:52.350
Umm, by.

00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:56.900
By when we say that OK we are targeting

00:53:56.900 --> 00:54:00.420
specific cells or at bring

00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:04.020
bringing in AI at cell level so OK there is a concept

00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:05.900
concept for AI for ran.

00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:08.420
And AI.

00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:13.900
Or ran AI itself right so if

00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:17.020
the domain in which autopilot

00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:20.220
works on is AI for run in which

00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:23.420
it has it acts upon externally it does

00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:26.540
not bring in the AI logic or deploys

00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:30.060
AI logic at ram level rather it's a

00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:33.900
it's a tool that sits outside and analyses the ran and

00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:37.500
then invokes needed functionality or needed changes in the in the

00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:37.900
in the.

00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:40.140
Ran using the.

00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:45.580
The machine learning data that it has gathered and analysed

00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:52.900
So if I'm not understanding this question correctly

00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:56.000
maybe you can share some more information

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.400
information on that and we can have a follow up.

00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:02.180
Mohan if you have something to add on on this particular question

00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:03.820
question, I'm not sure if I understood it correctly.

00:55:05.790 --> 00:55:08.990
Yeah unless I answered this so I think

00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:12.180
if this question is more towards

00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:15.740
bringing in the multi vendor capability

00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:18.860
so the solution orchestration is already the

00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:22.460
sound solutions are already multi vendor so the same

00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:25.660
support is extended for autopil

00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:29.180
autopilot as well so if that is not the

00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:32.550
underlying question maybe we can take this offline as well with

00:55:32.550 --> 00:55:33.030
well with Samuel.

00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:34.900
OK.

00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:39.420
Then just one one thing I would like to highlight.

00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:44.660
AI autopilot is an independent product but it does

00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:47.740
use the underlying class

00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:50.980
classic son to deploy these solutions so all the

00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:54.180
capabilities that are available and so on are available

00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:58.340
in autopilot because ultimately it is working on top

00:55:58.340 --> 00:56:02.500
of our mentor is on so function

00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:06.340
flexibilities or functionality such as mvie and all

00:56:17.050 --> 00:56:21.130
Yes and then one one question about

00:56:21.130 --> 00:56:24.730
some Samsung so called support is the autopilot

00:56:24.730 --> 00:56:25.810
autopilot supporting Samsung.

00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:27.660
That works.

00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:32.980
As of now son itself does not

00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:33.940
not support Samsung.

00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:39.700
And there are two reasons for that one is that

00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:43.100
Samsung itself is not a part of versus II

00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:46.460
So what it needs is that we have

00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:51.700
Take help from customer to get the needed inter

00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:53.700
interface. Pick under NDA and.

00:56:55.460 --> 00:56:58.700
Many a times the solution from Samsung

00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:00.980
may be customised from 1 customer to another.

00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:06.300
We do not have an umbrella interface spec

00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:09.540
we may not have an umbrella interface spec so that is one reason

00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:12.620
why as of now Samsung is not

00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:15.860
handled by son another

00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:16.540
Another reason is that.

00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:22.340
There has to be a good business use case so

00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:26.180
far whatever queries we have got we have not received

00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:29.380
a used case where song has to be included so in a nutshe

00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:30.340
nutshell, as of now there is no plan.

00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:35.220
To provide this functionality for Samsung

00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:35.300


00:57:36.730 --> 00:57:37.690
Have support for Samsung?

00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:42.900
Thank you vikas thank thank you all

00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:46.500
the listeners I think that we are ending this session and also

00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:50.060
thank thanks for the raya Mohan

00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:53.220
and vikas about presentation and

00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:55.460
and active answering to the questions.

00:58:01.050 --> 00:58:03.730
Thank you. Final word, final words because.

00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:10.620
Yeah so thank you for joining this

00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:13.940
session I hope it it gave you some information

00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:17.220
on what autopilot is what it is doing and how it is doing

00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:22.700
Yeah we we have some

00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:25.740
functionalities and capabilities already available and

00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:29.060
quite a lot of them are under development so yeah

00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:32.140
let's let's let's

00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:33.180
let's push it forward. Thank you.

00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:43.020
All right thank you so much everyone for joining in

00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:46.260
we can go ahead and close this call please do not forget to claim your

00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:49.540
credits for the session and once you've done that you are free

00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:52.700
to go thank you so much everyone for joining in and have a great

00:58:52.700 --> 00:58:54.420
great day. Thank you and bye bye. See you.

00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:14.740
